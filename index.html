    <header><h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome (welcome)
            Welcome (welcome)
            Welcome (welcome)
            Welcome to your fate
            End of the line
            It's just a little explanation of your desperate situation
            You're a slave to my design
            It's just a complex application to a deadly confrontation
            Take a taste (ooh)
            I'ma put your lights out (uh)
            I'ma rock your body (baby)
            'Til you cry those eyes out (ooh)
            I said, "Everybody, let's get naughty
            Let me introduce myself"
            I said, "I put that boogie in your body
            So you can't get down with no one else"
            You are so dead
            Dancing with the enemy
            And you are so dead
            Fighting with the melody
            Right into your face, try to survive
            It's just a loose interpretation of a broken combination
            Dig your grave and say goodbye
            It is an open invitation to a perfect domination
            What a waste (ooh)
            I'ma put your lights out (uh)
            I'ma rock your body (baby)
            'Til you cry those eyes out (ooh)
            I said, "Why don't you no hurt nobody?"
            Underestimate yourself
            Victorious over my dead body
            Sometimes I just scare myself
            You are so dead
            Dancing with the enemy
            You are so dead
            Fighting with the melody
            Go, go, go, go
            Go, go, go, go (darkness)
            Go, go, go, go
            Go, go, go, go (darkness)
            Go, go, go, go
            Go, go, go, go (darkness)
            Go, go, go, go
            Go, go, go, go
            Said, said, said, said, said, "Everybody, let's get naughty
            Let me introduce myself"
            I said, "I put that boogie in your body (body)
            So you can't get down with no one else"
            You are so dead
            Dancing with the enemy
            You are so dead
            Fighting with the melody
            I said, "Why don't you no hurt nobody?" ('Body)
            Underestimate yourself (yourself)
            Victorious over my dead body (body)
            Sometimes I just scare myself (myself)</p>
